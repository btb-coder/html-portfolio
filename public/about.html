<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My name is Samson Eniolorunda, a passionate and detail-driven full-stack web developer currently undergoing intensive training through a reputable online bootcamp.
  I recently transitioned into the world of web development out of a genuine love for technology and problem-solving. 
  With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and growing expertise in modern frameworks like React, Node.js, Express.js, etc., 
  I am committed to building innovative, responsive, and user-friendly websites. Whether it's for individuals, businesses, or personal projects, 
  I take pride in bringing digital ideas to life, and I aspire to one day build a dynamic gaming application. </p>

<p>I approach development with a creative mindset, strong attention to detail, and a drive to deliver high-quality results within deadlines.
   My workflow is supported by tools like VS Code, and I always aim to write clean, efficient code. When faced with challenges, 
   I rely on a methodical problem-solving approach, identifying errors, researching solutions, and seeking guidance from more experienced developers when necessary. 
   I value continuous learning and believe that growth happens through collaboration, curiosity, and persistence.</p>

<p>Beyond web development, I hold a Bachelor of Arts in History and International Studies from Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba. 
  My academic background has honed my research, analytical, and communication skills, which I now apply in the tech space. Looking ahead, 
  I plan to expand my skill set into blockchain development, exploring the endless possibilities of decentralized technologies. 
  My goal is to secure a fulfilling role in tech, either in a full-time, freelance, or remote capacity, while building solutions that create real impact.</p>
